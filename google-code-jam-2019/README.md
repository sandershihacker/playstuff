## Procrastination Context
On the afternoon of April 6th, 2019, Sander was procrastinating on doing his
homework for Undecidability and Incompleteness, when he received the email
that Google Code Jam had 7 hours left, so he decided to do a couple problems
and get enough points to pass the qualification round.
