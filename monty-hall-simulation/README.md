# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
This program simulates the Monty Hall Problem and outputs the probabilies
of switching vs not switching the doors.

## Instructions
Run the following bash command:
```bash
python ./monty_hall_simulation.py
```
And this will simulate 100000 tries of switching choices and not switching
choices during a Monty Hall game.

## Procrastination Context
On the afternoon of April 1st, 2019, Sander was procrastinating on doing his
Natural Language Processing quiz, and came across the website mentioned
below. Thus, he coded a simulation up in the library.
